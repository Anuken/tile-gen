# `tile-gen`
A simple [Rust (ðŸš€)](https://www.rust-lang.org/) project for generating bitmasked tile variants.

**Raw Image**: <br>

**Processed Image**: <br>
![example-tiled](/example-tiled.png) <br>

### Using the Generator
- Download the binary suitable for your OS and architecture from the [releases](https://github.com/GlennFolker/tile-gen/releases).
- Create your sprite:
  - The dimension size must be divisible by 4 and must be square.
  - Pixel scaling should be 1Ã—1.
- Run `tile-gen proc [your-sprite].png`. This will generate a new processed sprite with the name as your raw sprite name suffixed with `-tiled` (i.e., `[your-sprite]-tiled.png`).

### Using the Processed Sprite
- Split your sprites into 47 elements as shown below: <br>
  ![tile-indexing](/example-tiled-indexing.png)
- Count the mask by using `mask |= 1 << index`; treat `index` as: <br>
  ![mask-mapping](/mask-mapping.png)
- The sprite of the tile can be mapped from the `mask` by using `sprites[tiles[mask]]` where `tiles` is an array of the mapping returned by running `tile-gen mapping`:
